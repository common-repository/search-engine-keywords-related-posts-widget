Watches for hits arriving from search engines. Displays a list of posts related to the search engine keywords.

== Description ==
The Search Engine Keywords Related Posts Widget collects the query string from Google, Bing and Yahoo and extracts the keywords that the user used in his search. The widget then lists posts related to the search engine keywords. Since the search engines usually only show one result from your site, but there may be many pages that are related to the users search, this encourages surfers to browse through the posts related to their search. The widget is only visible when a user arrives through a Google, Bing, Yahoo, AOL, Ask, and Baidu searches. Bookmarked users and users referred from other sites do not see the widget.

Test the widget by finding your blog in a search engine and then clicking on the link. Users logged into Google do not pass their search parameters int he referrer information.
